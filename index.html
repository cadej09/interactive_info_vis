      <h3 id="sk2-narrative-title">Color/Temperature Gradient Clock</h3>
      
      <h4>Context</h4>
      <p>
        This clock is designed for anyone living a structured daily life who wants to understand 
        time through temperature and color rather than numbers. It's ideal for use as ambient wall 
        art, a desktop display, or a calming screensaver that helps users intuitively sense what 
        part of the day they're in without checking the exact time.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Design Decisions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Color Progression:</strong> I chose a gradient that moves from deep blue 
          (midnight/coldest) through light blue (dawn), yellow (morning warmth), orange-red 
          (noon/hottest), pink (sunset), purple (evening), and back to blue (night). This 
          mapping leverages the natural association between color temperature and time of day, 
          making the visualization immediately intuitive without requiring explanation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Horizontal Bar Layout:</strong> Rather than using a circular clock face, I 
          selected a horizontal bar that reads left-to-right like a timeline. This design 
          questions the convention that clocks must be circular and makes it easier to see the 
          full 24-hour progression at a glance. The layout works well on wide screens and 
          emphasizes the continuous flow of time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Current Time Indicator:</strong> A glowing white line and dot mark the exact 
          current time, providing precise temporal information while maintaining the clock's 
          aesthetic minimalism. The glow effect draws the eye and makes the indicator visible 
          against any gradient color. Time markers at 6-hour intervals (midnight, 6am, noon, 6pm) 
          provide reference points for orientation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Future Work</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Add interactivity where hovering over any position on the gradient shows a preview of 
          what time that represents, allowing users to "scrub" through the day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incorporate seasonal variations where the color palette shifts slightly based on the 
          time of year (cooler tones in winter, warmer in summer), making the clock responsive 
          to longer-term temporal cycles beyond just hours.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <img src="images/sk2-sketch-1.jpg" alt="Color Gradient Clock - Initial Sketch" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Step 1 — Initial Concept:</strong> First sketch exploring the gradient bar 
        concept. Annotated with color stops at key times of day (midnight, dawn, noon, sunset). 
        Considered vertical vs. horizontal orientation and decided horizontal better represents 
        time's linear progression.

      <img src="images/sk2-sketch-2.jpg" alt="Color Gradient Clock - After Feedback" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Step 2 — Refinement After Feedback:</strong> Based on peer feedback that the 
        time indicators were hard to read, I added larger hour markers and the glowing current 
        time indicator. Also added the temperature label ("Cool", "Warm", "Hot") below the 
        gradient to reinforce the metaphor.

      <img src="images/sk2-sketch-3.jpg" alt="Color Gradient Clock - Final Design" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Step 3 — Final Polish:</strong> Added digital time display at the top for 
        those who need exact time, while keeping the gradient as the primary feature. Refined 
        color transitions to be smoother and more visually appealing. Added border to the 
        gradient bar for better definition.

    <!-- Homework 4: Sketch B - Water Transfer -->

      <h3 id="sk3-narrative-title">Water Transfer Clock</h3>
      
      <h4>Context</h4>
      <p>
        This clock is designed for individuals who want to visualize their daily energy cycle 
        in a tangible, physical way. It's particularly suited for people interested in wellness, 
        mindfulness, or productivity tracking—anyone who thinks about how their energy depletes 
        during the day and restores at night. The clock could exist as a desk display or wall 
        installation in a home office or bedroom.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Design Decisions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Reversible Flow Metaphor:</strong> Water flows left-to-right during the day 
          (6am-6pm) and right-to-left during the night (6pm-6am), representing how our energy 
          empties through daily activities and refills during rest. This bidirectional flow 
          challenges the typical unidirectional representation of time and emphasizes the 
          cyclical nature of our circadian rhythms. The reversal at 6pm and 6am creates a 
          natural breaking point between day and night phases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Water Level Visualization:</strong> Each bucket shows a percentage (0-100%) 
          and has hour markers on the side, making it easy to read approximate time while 
          maintaining the tangible feeling of watching water transfer. The animated wave on 
          the water surface and the dripping particles between buckets add life and movement, 
          reinforcing that this is an active, ongoing process—not a static measurement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sun/Moon Context Indicators:</strong> Icons at the top clearly show whether 
          it's daytime (sun with rays) or nighttime (moon with stars), removing any ambiguity 
          about which direction the water flows and why. The progress bar shows how far through 
          the current phase you are, with descriptive text ("Energy depleting through the day" 
          vs. "Energy restoring through the night") that makes the metaphor explicit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Future Work</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Add customizable bucket designs (coffee cups for morning people, water bottles for 
          fitness enthusiasts, battery icons for tech workers) to personalize the energy 
          metaphor to different lifestyles and contexts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement click-to-preview functionality where users can click on a specific hour 
          marker to see what the buckets would look like at that time, useful for planning 
          activities based on anticipated energy levels.
        </li>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/sk3-sketch-1.jpg" alt="Water Transfer Clock - Initial Sketch" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Step 1 — Initial Concept:</strong> First sketch showing two buckets with water 
        flow between them. Annotated the day/night flow direction and noted that percentages 
        should add to 100%. Explored whether to show actual water drops or just levels.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="images/sk3-sketch-2.jpg" alt="Water Transfer Clock - After Feedback" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Step 2 — Refinement After Feedback:</strong> Peers suggested adding clearer 
        indicators of which direction is day vs. night. Added sun and moon icons at the top. 
        Also added the pipe with arrow between buckets to make the flow direction more obvious. 
        Considered adding hour markers on bucket sides for easier time reading.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="images/sk3-sketch-3.jpg" alt="Water Transfer Clock - Final Design" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Step 3 — Final Polish:</strong> Added all the details: hour markers, 
        percentages, progress bar, and animated water drops. Refined the wave animation on 
        water surface. Added descriptive text that makes the energy depletion/restoration 
        metaphor explicit. Adjusted bucket sizing for better visual balance.
