      <h3 id="sk2-narrative-title">Color/Temperature Gradient Clock</h3>
      
      <h4>Context</h4>
      <p>
        This clock is designed for anyone living a structured daily life who wants to understand 
        time through temperature and color rather than numbers. It's ideal for use as ambient wall 
        art, a desktop display, or a calming screensaver that helps users intuitively sense what 
        part of the day they're in without checking the exact time.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Design Decisions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Color Progression:</strong> I chose a gradient that moves from deep blue 
          (midnight/coldest) through light blue (dawn), yellow (morning warmth), orange-red 
          (noon/hottest), pink (sunset), purple (evening), and back to blue (night). This 
          mapping leverages the natural association between color temperature and time of day, 
          making the visualization immediately intuitive without requiring explanation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Horizontal Bar Layout:</strong> Rather than using a circular clock face, I 
          selected a horizontal bar that reads left-to-right like a timeline. This design 
          questions the convention that clocks must be circular and makes it easier to see the 
          full 24-hour progression at a glance. The layout works well on wide screens and 
          emphasizes the continuous flow of time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Current Time Indicator:</strong> A glowing white line and dot mark the exact 
          current time, providing precise temporal information while maintaining the clock's 
          aesthetic minimalism. The glow effect draws the eye and makes the indicator visible 
          against any gradient color. Time markers at 6-hour intervals (midnight, 6am, noon, 6pm) 
          provide reference points for orientation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Future Work</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Add interactivity where hovering over any position on the gradient shows a preview of 
          what time that represents, allowing users to "scrub" through the day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incorporate seasonal variations where the color palette shifts slightly based on the 
          time of year (cooler tones in winter, warmer in summer), making the clock responsive 
          to longer-term temporal cycles beyond just hours.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <figcaption>
        <strong>Step 1 — Initial Concept:</strong> First sketch exploring the gradient bar 
        concept. Annotated with color stops at key times of day (midnight, dawn, noon, sunset). 
        Considered vertical vs. horizontal orientation and decided horizontal better represents 
        time's linear progression.

      <img src="images/sk2-sketch-2.jpg" alt="Color Gradient Clock - After Feedback" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Step 2 — Refinement After Feedback:</strong> Based on peer feedback that the 
        time indicators were hard to read, I added larger hour markers and the glowing current 
        time indicator. Also added the temperature label ("Cool", "Warm", "Hot") below the 
        gradient to reinforce the metaphor.

      <img src="images/sk2-sketch-3.jpg" alt="Color Gradient Clock - Final Design" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Step 3 — Final Polish:</strong> Added digital time display at the top for 
        those who need exact time, while keeping the gradient as the primary feature. Refined 
        color transitions to be smoother and more visually appealing. Added border to the 
        gradient bar for better definition.

      <h3 id="sk3-narrative-title">Water Transfer Clock</h3>
      
      <h4>Context</h4>
      <p>
        This clock is designed for individuals who want to visualize their daily energy cycle 
        in a tangible, physical way. It's particularly suited for people interested in wellness, 
        mindfulness, or productivity tracking—anyone who thinks about how their energy depletes 
        during the day and restores at night. The clock could exist as a desk display or wall 
        installation in a home office or bedroom.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Design Decisions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Reversible Flow Metaphor:</strong> Water flows left-to-right during the day 
          (6am-6pm) and right-to-left during the night (6pm-6am), representing how our energy 
          empties through daily activities and refills during rest. This bidirectional flow 
          challenges the typical unidirectional representation of time and emphasizes the 
          cyclical nature of our circadian rhythms. The reversal at 6pm and 6am creates a 
          natural breaking point between day and night phases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Water Level Visualization:</strong> Each bucket shows a percentage (0-100%) 
          and has hour markers on the side, making it easy to read approximate time while 
          maintaining the tangible feeling of watching water transfer. The animated wave on 
          the water surface and the dripping particles between buckets add life and movement, 
          reinforcing that this is an active, ongoing process—not a static measurement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sun/Moon Context Indicators:</strong> Icons at the top clearly show whether 
          it's daytime (sun with rays) or nighttime (moon with stars), removing any ambiguity 
          about which direction the water flows and why. The progress bar shows how far through 
          the current phase you are, with descriptive text ("Energy depleting through the day" 
          vs. "Energy restoring through the night") that makes the metaphor explicit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Future Work</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Add customizable bucket designs (coffee cups for morning people, water bottles for 
          fitness enthusiasts, battery icons for tech workers) to personalize the energy 
          metaphor to different lifestyles and contexts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement click-to-preview functionality where users can click on a specific hour 
          marker to see what the buckets would look like at that time, useful for planning 
          activities based on anticipated energy levels.

        <strong>Step 1 — Initial Concept:</strong> First sketch showing two buckets with water 
        flow between them. Annotated the day/night flow direction and noted that percentages 
        should add to 100%. Explored whether to show actual water drops or just levels.

        <strong>Step 2 — Refinement After Feedback:</strong> Peers suggested adding clearer 
        indicators of which direction is day vs. night. Added sun and moon icons at the top. 
        Also added the pipe with arrow between buckets to make the flow direction more obvious. 
        Considered adding hour markers on bucket sides for easier time reading.

        percentages, progress bar, and animated water drops. Refined the wave animation on 
        water surface. Added descriptive text that makes the energy depletion/restoration 
        metaphor explicit. Adjusted bucket sizing for better visual balance.

      <h3 id="sk4-narrative-title">Character Activity Clock (FINAL DESIGN)</h3>
      
      <h4>Context</h4>
      <p>
        This clock is designed for anyone who experiences time through activities rather than 
        abstract numbers—essentially everyone living a structured daily life. It's particularly 
        relatable for students, professionals, and families who follow similar routines each day. 
        The clock could exist as a smart home display, a mobile app widget, or interactive wall 
        art in communal spaces like kitchens or living rooms where multiple people check the time 
        throughout the day.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Design Decisions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Activity-Based Time Representation:</strong> Instead of showing hours and 
          minutes, this clock displays what a person is typically doing at the current time—
          sleeping, working, eating, exercising, etc. This design fundamentally questions the 
          assumption that time should be represented numerically, instead showing time as lived 
          experience. Each activity has a distinct color and icon, making it immediately clear 
          what "time" it is through context rather than numbers. The 24-hour day is divided 
          into 13 distinct activities, each with its own time slot, creating a visual story of 
          a complete day.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Circular Layout with Current Activity Highlighted:</strong> All activities are 
          arranged in a circle like a traditional clock, maintaining familiarity while completely 
          reimagining what's displayed. The current activity expands and brightens while others 
          fade, drawing immediate attention to "now" while still showing the full day's context. 
          A red indicator line points to the exact current time, and the large character icon in 
          the center performs the current activity, creating both macro (full day) and micro 
          (current moment) views simultaneously. The background color changes based on the 
          current activity, further immersing users in that time's context.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Character Icons with Story:</strong> Each activity is illustrated with a simple 
          stick figure character performing that action—sleeping in bed with "ZZZ", sitting at a 
          desk working, lifting dumbbells exercising, etc. These icons were designed to be 
          immediately recognizable even at small sizes, using universal symbols (bed, computer, 
          plate, dumbbell, shower). The character approach makes the clock feel personal and 
          human rather than mechanical, reinforcing that time is something we experience through 
          our bodies and actions, not just observe on a device.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Why This is My Final Choice</h4>
      <p>
        I selected this design as my final clock because it most successfully achieves the 
        assignment's goal of questioning how time is represented. Rather than using colors, 
        shapes, or abstract patterns to encode hours and minutes, this clock completely 
        reimagines what we mean by "what time is it"—answering instead with what you're doing. 
        It's the most relatable and human-centered of my designs, connecting directly to how 
        people actually experience their days. The technical implementation was also the most 
        challenging and rewarding, requiring careful state management, custom icon drawing 
        functions, and thoughtful animation, which allowed me to demonstrate growth in my p5.js 
        skills throughout this assignment.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Future Work</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Add customization where users can define their own daily schedule with personalized 
          activities and times, making the clock a true reflection of their unique routine 
          rather than a generic daily schedule. Could save multiple profiles for different 
          days of the week (weekday vs. weekend routines).
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement smooth animated transitions between activities—the character could walk from 
          one location to another when moving from "work" to "commute", or gradually close their 
          eyes when transitioning to "sleep". Add particle effects (coffee steam, sweat drops, 
          water drops) that activate during relevant activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create an interactive mode where clicking on any activity jumps to that time and shows 
          a "preview" of what your day looks like at that moment, useful for planning ahead or 
          reflecting on your daily patterns.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/sk4-sketch-1.jpg" alt="Character Activity Clock - Initial Sketch" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Step 1 — Initial Concept:</strong> First sketch mapping out a full 24-hour 
        schedule with 13 distinct activities. Drew rough stick figures for each activity 
        (sleeping, working, eating, exercising). Debated between circular and linear layout—
        circular won because it's more familiar and shows the cyclical nature of daily routine. 
        Noted which activities take the most time (work: 8 hours, sleep: 6 hours).

    <figure>
      <img src="images/sk4-sketch-2.jpg" alt="Character Activity Clock - After First Feedback" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Step 2 — Refinement After First Feedback:</strong> Based on feedback, added 
        more detail to the center display—not just the activity name but a large version of 
        the character performing that activity. Peers suggested color-coding activities by type 
        (work vs. leisure vs. self-care). Sketched ideas for making the current activity more 
        prominent (larger size, glow effect, or both). Added time indicator line pointing to 
        current position.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="images/sk4-sketch-3.jpg" alt="Character Activity Clock - After Second Feedback" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Step 3 — Second Iteration:</strong> Refined icon designs after testing showed 
        some activities were hard to distinguish (commute vs. exercise). Made icons more 
        specific: car with motion lines for commute, dumbbells for exercise, shower head with 
        water drops for shower. Added background color changes that reflect the current 
        activity's mood/energy level. Sketch shows the layout more precisely with measurements.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="images/sk4-sketch-4.jpg" alt="Character Activity Clock - Final Polish" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Step 4 — Final Polish:</strong> After third round of feedback, added small 
        details to make icons more expressive: "ZZZ" above sleeping character, sweat drops 
        during exercise, steam from coffee cup during morning routine. Refined the circle 
        segmentation to make activity boundaries clearer. Added digital time display at top 
        for users who still need to know exact time while appreciating the activity-based 
        representation.
